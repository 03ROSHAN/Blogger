            <p><b>Learn the Basics of programming</b>
                <br>
                Coding, also known as programming, is the process of creating instructions for computers to execute. It involves writing sets of precise commands in a programming language to perform specific tasks. Programmers use a variety of languages such as Python, Java, or JavaScript to communicate with computers and build software 
                <span class="read-more-text">
                   applications. Coding is the backbone of software development, enabling the creation of websites, mobile apps, and other software products. It requires logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and attention to detail. Programmers write code to define algorithms, design user interfaces, and manipulate data. The code is then translated into machine-readable instructions that computers can understand and execute. Learning to code opens doors to diverse career opportunities in technology, from web development and data science to artificial intelligence and software engineering. As technology continues to advance, coding remains a crucial skill for those seeking to innovate, automate processes, and contribute to the ever-evolving digital landscape.

                    <b>How does coding works</b>
                    Coding is the process of instructing computers to perform specific tasks through the creation of sequences of commands, known as code. At its core, code is written in programming languages, such as Python, Java, or JavaScript, which serve as intermediaries between human-readable instructions and machine-executable actions. 

                    Programmers use a set of rules and syntax within these languages to craft algorithms and logic that guide the computer's behavior. Each line of code communicates a specific operation, whether it's processing data, displaying information, or executing complex computations. 
                    
                    The code is then translated by a compiler or interpreter into machine code, a language the computer's central processing unit (CPU) can directly understand and execute. This seamless translation enables the computer to follow the programmer's instructions and produce the desired outcomes, be it running a software application, powering a website, or controlling hardware.
                    
                    Coding demands precision, problem-solving skills, and creativity. Programmers iterate, test, and refine their code to ensure it functions as intended. The collaborative efforts of developers worldwide contribute to the vast array of software applications and technological advancements that shape our digital landscape.

                   <b>Types of Programming Languages</b> 
                   Binary code comprises a series of zeros and ones, used to communicate instructions. This code is a low-level programming language. Each digit in a coded sequence connects to a switch in your computer. Each switch connects to an action, and together thousands of switches operate a device.

                   High-level code, a computer communication process that works much like human language, allows programmers to operate entire systems simultaneously. High-level programming languages convert human language from programmers into binary code that computers understand.

                    <b>What Is Coding Used For?</b>
                    Developers use a variety of programming languages to build websites and applications. Front-end developers typically use HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code to create website layouts and design functions.

                    Websites with user accounts, like Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn, require back-end developers to write computer code that connects websites to databases. Back-end developers often write code using languages such as SQL, Java, and Python.
                    
                    Developers use other languages like Python, Objective-C, C#, Swift, or Ruby on Rails to create apps for cell phones and computer software.
